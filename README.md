Generate publications webpage from a google scholar. This occurs in two steps:

1. Generate bibtex from a google scholar
2. Generate webpage from a bibtex

By using bibtex as an intermediate representation, you can choose to make
modifications beyond what is supported in the current bibtex-builder. The
website-builder also supports:

- Several website themes
- Multiple bibtexs, including online sources
